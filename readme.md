To run this project start by:

```js
npm i -g @ionic/cli
```
then start an empty template --> Only one time for new project

```js
 ionic start myApp blank --type react
```
To open the app just run the serve

Run serve |> 
```js
 ionic serve
```

To build the app we need 

```js

```
We can see what this amazing command has created into dist folder

Then we tried ionic cap add ios 

```js
 ionic cap add ios
```

AND android folder too

```

```js
 ionic cap open android
```
Then try syncronization
